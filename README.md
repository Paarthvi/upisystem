# UPI System

# Description

UPI is the abbreviation for “Unified Payments Interface”, this is an interface on the age-old banking system to make instant payments from one individual to another or between commercial businesses.

For this project, we have design and simulated a backend database for a UPI System. The system supports registering as consumer and merchant, creating bank accounts, registering for UPI and making transaction using bank account as well as UPI.

The UML diagram for the database has been shared below:

The front-end for this project has been implemented using Python Flask and supports initialization of the transactions, querying the history of transactions and bank details. It also displays metrics such as consumer vs merchant transactions.
